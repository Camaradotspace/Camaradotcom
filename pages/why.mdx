# Why Camara

I love working on side projects and I love to put a lot of care into them because I love to build things that "work".

Building beautiful, accessible and responsive user interfaces contributes to a successful side project. When building my side projects, I spend a lot of time trying to get the interface right, and less time on other technical pieces of the project.

Having a well designed user interface in my projects is very important to me. I find it unfriendly to work only on the technical part of my ideas, and package it loosely because "well, it works".

To build projects that feel like enough thought and care was put into making them, there has to be a balance between getting the interface to where I want it to be and working on other technical pieces.

This is why I set out to build a design system. Camara is an attempt at creating that balance.

> If you make a lot of side projects or have made one before, think of all the time you spent in trying to get the user interface to the point you wanted it to be. Accessible, beautiful, and responsive.  
> Now think of halving that time and investing it into all the other piece of your project that isn't about the interface. How would that have empowered you into making a more rounded project?

Camara aims to buy you back that time. With Camara, building your interfaces is easy and with less code. This empowers you to bring your ideas to life faster and invest time in all other pieces that makes your project tick.

With a design system that takes inspiration from some interesting ideas and best practices around building accessible, beautiful and responsive user interfaces alongside my learnings from past side projects, I can bring my ideas to life faster, without losing out on the thoughtfulness and care I love to put into my side projects.

Camara is a design system that helps you build your ideas quickly and with less code. It's an open source project, and it's available to anyone who wants to build with it.
