# Introduction

> Add Brand Image Here

> It's our first time open-sourcing a serious project, and we want to increase our chances of having a positive experience. We hope this helps us communicate the right expectations on our work.

Camara is a design system that helps you build your ideas quickly and with less code. It's an open source project, and it's available to anyone who wants to build with it.

Not much new ideas in it but it will be easy to use and with a reasonable amount of flexibility. Straight up, we are not embarking on building the most robust and flexible UI component library ever.  
What we are building is a simple UI component library that has been thoughtfully designed and implemented, to scratch our own itch of having to avoid build the same stuffs over again when working on our simple side projects.

## Using this site

The Camara homepage provides expanded guidance and documentation on the design language, component library and style/pattern guide. We want our users to have as much information as possible while exploring Camara.

If you’re new to Camara, start with our [getting started guide](/docs/start/get-started). It has everything you need to design and develop your side projects with Camara.

## Production Use

Camara isn’t ready for production use yet, but we want to give you an early preview of what’s coming. We'd love you to give it a try. As always, we encourage feedback and contributions. We plan to launch Beta this summer and 1.0 early next year.

## Contributions

This project will be open for contributions at version 1.0, right now, our only goal is to show off our work (what we are building) while still working on it publicly. The focus is on getting it to where we feel would be a solid start to our vision - helping you build your ideas quickly and with less code.

You will notice the absence of a contribution guide, and some other piece of a regular open-source project. These are things we are gearing work on and making plans to make them available as soon as we begin accepting contributions.

While we could easily keep working on this in stealth and release when we are ready, we do not think this is the right decision for us at this moment. We are huge advocates of working in public and are proud to show our initial ideas while documenting our progress to where we want to go.  
Also, building in public keeps us much more accountable and helps fuel our momentum to get our ideas out. We hope you understand this and are excited as much as we look forward to Camara V1.

### Third Heading

Here is some code

```js
const x = "fucking";
console.log("hello " + x + " world");
```

## Using the playground

You can use live react code to display react component with a preview

<Playground>
  <div style={{ width: 100, height: 100, background: "lightblue" }}>
    hello everyone
  </div>
</Playground>

<Playground>
    <Avatar />
</Playground>
